                            This air conditioner size calculator, also known as an AC Tonnage calculator, air conditioner size calculator helps you to choose what size of air conditioner, so By using the existing heating/cooling ducts that encompass the entire home. Of course, the choice of brand and air conditioner type still depends on you. This air conditioner calculator can only provide you the recommended output power of the AC, in Tons for your room.

                        <p>
                            Choosing the right sized air conditioner can be as easy as using a tape measure and a little mathematics.Simply measure the length and width of a room and figure the square footage.

                        <p>
                            Finding the correct  AC size (or other AC unit size) is a priority to making your home comfortable. An air conditioner is an investment, so finding the right one the first time can make the purchase process go much more smoothly.

This depends on factors like room size, city of use, number of people in a room, number of appliances in the room.

                        If you do not know your room's covered area then, find it by using measuring tools you have and measure the length and the width of your room. Input these values in our air conditioner room size calculator to instantly get your room's area. If you have an irregularly shaped room, you can use our square footage calculator and choose the multiple rooms option to help you determine the area of your room.

                            <p>The British thermal unit (BTU or Btu) is a unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of cooling or heating appliance. One British Thermal Unit is the amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by 1°F.</p>

                        Finding the correct AC size (or other AC unit size) is a priority to making your home comfortable. An air conditioner is an investment, so finding the right one the first time can make the purchase process go much more smoothly. it is very important if you want to minimize your electricity bill. A small air conditioner will have a hard time cooling a large room, or it might not be able to cool it at all.

                        On the other hand, choosing a huge air conditioner could cool the room very fast, but won't dehumidify the room at all. This particular instance leaves the room cold and, at the same time, clammy, which is not comfortable at all. Therefore, it is crucial to decide what size of air conditioner you need before buying one.
